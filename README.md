- Travel-O-Lette: This is a random location/trip generator. It uses multiple API's from google maps and ticketmaster to randomly generate a location, provide hotel listings with detailed information on a map, along with displaying the top events for that location over the next year. There is also a login/signout feature which allows the user to save their preferred events/locations, as well as a favorites page that displays the events that the users choose to save.

- GifHub: This website is a central hub for any and all gifs, utilizing the Giffy API to display the top 15 relevant gifs based on the users search parameters.

- Crystal Collector: This is a number guessing game where the user has to figure out how much each crystal is worth by clicking on any of the 4 available crystals, while also trying to land on (but not go over) the goal number. Wins/losses are tracked and displayed to the user.

- The Office Trivia: This is a simple trivia quiz based off the hit comedy series "The Office." There is a 1 minute timer that ticks down indicating the time-remaining. When the timer reaches 0, or the user submits the quiz, the score is then tallied and displayed on a second screen.

- Railway Registry: This is a train scheduling web application utilizing the Firebase web server to store user input and display on-screen.

- Psychic Game: This is a simple letter guessing game that prompts the user to try to guess the letter that the computer has chosen. The user has 10 attempts to guess the correct letter, or they lose the game, tallying a loss, and restarting. The incorrect guesses are also displayed on the bottom of the screen.
